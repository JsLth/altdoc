## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 note


This is a new release after the package was removed from CRAN.

April 25th: CRAN team notified me of errors in the package (0.1.0)

May 1st: I submit 0.2.0 that fixes this error. I have an answer of Uwe Ligges who
tells me that the package is on its way to CRAN.

May 9th: package is removed from CRAN even if I wasn't notified of new errors.

Therefore, this is the exact same version asI submitted on May 1st.
