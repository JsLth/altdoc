Reformat the README

To use Docute or Docsify, the format of Markdown files has to follow a precise
structure. There must be at most one main section (starting with '#')
but there can be as many subsections and subsubsections as you want.

If you saw a message saying that \code{README.md} was slightly modified, it
is because the README didn't follow these rules. There probably was several
main sections, which messed up with Docute organization. Therefore,
\code{altdoc} automatically added a '#' to all sections and subsections,
except the first one, which is usually the title of the package.

For example, if your README looked like this:\preformatted{# Package

# Installation

## Stable version

## Dev version

Hello

# Demo

Hello again
}

It will now look like that:\preformatted{# Package

## Installation

### Stable version

### Dev version

Hello

## Demo

Hello again
}

Note that the main structure is preserved: "Stable version" and "Dev
version" are still subsections of "Installation".

Also, if your README includes R comments in code chunks, these will not
be modified.
